ABC STEP Website Redesign

The STEP Vanity Website Redesign is a complete redesign of seven anchors/tabs on the one pager website. I hardcoded out the entire website. The content was taken from the original platform on Adobe Muse and was redesigned by me. I added new pictures and icons, changed the colors, and reformatted the content. The site is now user and mobile friendly! The time it took to complete this project was 2 weeks.
